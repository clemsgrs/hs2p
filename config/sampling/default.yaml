alpha: 0.6 # controls the opacity of the overlayed annotation mask (closer to 1 = less transparent)
sort: False # whether or not to sort patches with annotated area above filtering_threshold by decreasing area

seg_params:

  downsample: 64 # if seg_level = -1, then uses this value to find the closest downsample level in the WSI for tissue segmentation computation
  sthresh: 8 # segmentation threshold (positive integer, using a higher threshold leads to less foreground and more background detection) (not used when use_otsu=True)

  a_t: 16 # area filter threshold for tissue (positive integer, the minimum size of detected foreground contours to consider, relative to the reference patch size ref_patch_size, e.g. a value 10 means only detected foreground contours of size greater than 10 [ref_patch_size, ref_patch_size] sized patches at spacing patch_params.spacing will be processed)

  overlap: 0. # percentage of overlap between two consecutive patches (float between 0 and 1)
  downsample: -1 # uses this value to find the closest downsample level in the annotation mask to extract patches with enough annotated area (the bigger the faster but the less precise ; -1 means patching at level closest to given spacing value)
  use_padding: True # whether to pad the border of the slide
  contour_fn: 'pct' # contour checking function to decide whether a patch should be considered foreground or background (choices between 'pct' - checks if the given patch has enough tissue using the following parameter as decision threshold, 'four_pt' - checks if all four points in a small grid around the center of the patch are inside the contour, 'center' - checks if the center of the patch is inside the contour, 'basic' - checks if the top-left corner of the patch is inside the contour)
